# netflix_suggestion_analysis

In this project, I explored how Netflix's content suggestions influence what we watch. By looking at how people interact with the recommended shows and movies, some interesting patterns emerged:
Analyss of the data: Using Power BI, I analyzed data of the watch history which I got from kaggle and from that random customers data. I made the analytics which is attached below

Influence of Suggestions: Many users end up watching content that Netflix suggests to them, showing just how powerful these recommendations can be.
Discovery of New Content: Thanks to the suggestions, users often find themselves watching genres or shows they wouldn't have found on their own.
Overall, this project highlights just how much Netflix's recommendation system shapes our viewing habits, making it easier and more enjoyable to discover new content.
